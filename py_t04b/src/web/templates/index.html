        <h3>What is Tic-Tac-Toe?</h3>
        <p>Tic-tac-toe, or noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players
            who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. </p>
        <p>The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first is
            the winner.</p>
        <p>It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.</p>
        <p>Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one
            of the nine spaces in the grid.</p>
        <p>There is no universally agreed rule as to who plays first, but commonly X plays first.</p>
        <p>Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often
            played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.</p>
