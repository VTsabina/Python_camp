        <h3>History of the game</h3>
        <p>Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have
            been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.</p>

        <p>An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called
            terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only
            three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.</p>

        <p>The different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to "noughts and crosses" (nought
            being an alternative word for 'zero'), the British name, appeared in 1858, in an issue of Notes and
            Queries. The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884. The US renaming
            of "noughts and crosses" to "tic-tac-toe" occurred in the 20th century.</p>

        <p>In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Sandy Douglas for the EDSAC
            computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games. The computer
            player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.</p>

        <p></p>In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy
        elements. The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe
        perfectly.[15] It is currently on display at the Computer History Museum.</p>
